# Simple Expense Tracker
I built this project after learning JavaScript, and React to improve my skills. This project is also similar to 
a school group project that we built using Xamarin. Though the school project had more features, 
I simply worked on the authentication process using Firebase. I used a simple process to add 
and delete expenses with no further features. 

## Features
* User authentication (email + password)

## Technologies / Required Software
* Firebase: 9.9.2
* React: 18.2.0
* React-Router-Dom: 6.3.0
* HTML5
* CSS3

Though, I secured the app Firestore, please use fake data if you want to try it.
